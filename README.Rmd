## Compiling Advanced R

### Step 1
First I had to download Rtools then it didn’t work because I didn’t have the newest version of R. I installed the newer version of RStudio but it didn’t work because I needed the newer version of R. Then I had to go and install the latest version of R which is the 4.0.2 version. 

I encountered trouble when I tried to knit, I found out that it was the wrong command
I then used the build button but that didn’t work because it can only work inside an RProject. I then switched my project(none) to adv-r Project. 

## Step 2
install packages listed in `Description` file. 

## Step 3
install fonts: inconsolata, andale mono,
